# ARCADE HANG TRAN :joystick:

## Brief overview :memo:

This repository consists of one of many retro arcade games featured on this github. Which will be first written in Python, then C++, then C then Assembly to understand the abstraction layers and develop an appreciation for modern tools. Where the first two will be web based and the other will be gui based. Preserving my nostalgia of classic arcade games and remembering times that were simpler. After I have developed a handful of arcade games, hardware based repos will start popping up to be run on an actual arcade system based on an arduino or a rasberry pi.

## Context :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Back when I was living the college experience I would sometimes go to the arcade and order a few drinks and play pac-man as if it just came out.
